# Processing.js IDE (early prototype)

This is an early prototype of a project to create a lightweight web-based IDE
for [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/).

The target audience are students in Japan who participate in introductory
programming workshops, having the first ever experience of text-based
programming. For this reason the main focus areas of this project will be:

*   Lint and compilation checks.

*   Online / inline help system.

*   Translation of the interface to Japanese.

Currently this project only includes the local version of HTML files for quick
development.

## Getting started
